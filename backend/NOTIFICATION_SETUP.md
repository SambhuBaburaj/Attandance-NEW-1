SMS_FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### 3. WhatsApp Token Update
Update the expired token in `.env`:
```env

```

### 4. Push Notifications
**For pop-ups on phones to work:**
- Parents must install your mobile app
- App must request notification permissions
- App must register push tokens with your server

## Testing

### Test all services:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test/notifications
```

### Send real notification:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/notifications/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-JWT-TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Alert",
    "message": "This is a test notification",
    "targetType": "ALL_PARENTS",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "sendWhatsApp": true
  }'
```

2. **Email**: Sent to all parent email addresses ‚úÖ
3. **Push**: Pop-ups on phones (if app installed) ‚ö†Ô∏è
4. **WhatsApp**: Messages to opted-in parents ‚ö†Ô∏è
